<h1>Network Topology Design</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this lab, I designed both a mock physical and logical network topology with LibreDraw, an open-source vector graphic editor. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>LibreDraw graphic editor</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 virtual machine</b>


<h2>Project walk-through</h2>

<br />
<br />
Ensure the Gallery tab is displayed. To have space in the application, the Pages pane can be closed  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Draw a building with 2 floors, a ground floor, and a basement. 
Then in the Gallery pane, scroll down and select the VRT Networking & Communications menu <br/>

<br />
<br />
Add a switch to each floor by dragging the switch from the Gallery to the appropriate floor. The switch icon will need to be resized accordingly <br/>

In the Gallery pane, select the Router icon and place it in the Basement <br/>

<br />
<br />
From the Gallery, pane select the cloud icon - Wireless Network /Internet and place it outside the Basement.

<br />
<br />
Select the Connectors fly-out menu on the left pane, and click Connector with Arrows.
  <br />

<br />
  <br />
Using the selected connector connect all the devices, ensuring all of the connectors run through the Cabling Conduit
  <br />
<br />

<br />
   <br />
Select the connections from the Basement to the Floor 2 switch
  <br/>

<br /> 
  <br />
Select the Line Color fly-out menu and click Red to change the colour of the connection.
In this example, the connection's colour was changed to red, indicating that a fibre connection was used. The black connections can be used to indicate that a copper ethernet cable is used.

 Other applications can be used, like Figjam (which will involve manually uploading component images), an easier alternative will be Draw.io
